- Add the ability to use more kinds of keys
- More locations for config, including a global one
- Improve install script

[1.1.0 2022-06-19]
- Add rotation gesture
- Add any-command action
- Can now specify config file to use
- Rework how sequential gestures are counted
	This fixes the problem with diagonal swipes triggering a lot of stuff
	simultaneously
- Make other gestures reversible, not just cardinals
	So now you can rotate in one direction, in other, and then in the first
	direction again, without lifting your fingers
